# Secure-Shared-File-Storage-Using-Hybrid-Cryptography-and-FTP
Objective: To Achieve a secure shared file access using Hybrid Cryptography and FTP
FTP is an old Internet protocol where files can be shared via upload/download mechanism.
The purpose of this project is to build a secure platform of file sharing using FTP and multiple ciphers 
encryption. The requirements are that a file owner can upload an encrypted file to an FTP server. Other users 
can download the file from the server and then request the encryption keys of the file using their public keys, 
hence only the users granted this key can decrypt the downloaded file
